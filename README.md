47* in Advent of code just missing day 21 and day 24 p2 hopefully my day 21 does work but my laptop keeps crashing when run. Looking back, these are incredibly incoherent 
complicated messes of code but i thing after day 17 they get a bit better as i actually dat down and wrote it all out first
to put the input most use a text file in the same directory as the file named Input data.txt and some depend on the input data having an extra new line at the end
Favourite problems were 22p2,23p2 and 15p2 and my least favourite probably Day6 p2 as i have no concept of time.
If you are a university, acedemic institute, etc. I think i would take more time doing the first 15 or 16, but beyond that i think i had some very neat solutions

Lots of these have been mutilated and so may not fully work, give answers to part 1's or take a while to run

Some of my solutions aren't on this laptop so i need to get to where the others are stored to update it.
